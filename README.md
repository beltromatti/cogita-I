# Cogita I

## Overview
**Cogita I** is an AI model based on the *DeepSeek Coder v1 1.3B* architecture, fine-tuned specifically for the purpose of generating and explaining code in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, with a strong educational focus.

The model is currently under active fine-tuning and is designed to assist students, researchers, and practitioners in understanding and developing AI models and algorithms. **Cogita I** will be made available in English only.

This project represents a foundational milestone and a prototype for the non-profit organization **Noesis AI**, and it is fully supported through the personal contributions of its collaborators. The model and its tools are planned to be released in the coming months under an open-source license.

## Availability
- The **model will be released on HuggingFace** once fine-tuning is completed: [Cogita I on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/beltromatti/cogita-I)
