# Cogita I

## Overview
**Cogita I** is an AI model based on the *DeepSeek Coder v1 1.3B* architecture, fine-tuned specifically for the purpose of generating and explaining code in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, with a strong educational focus.

The model is currently under active fine-tuning and is designed to assist students, researchers, and practitioners in understanding and developing AI models and algorithms. **Cogita I** will be made available in English only.

This project represents a foundational milestone and a prototype for the non-profit organization **Noesis AI**, and it is fully supported through the personal contributions of its collaborators. The model and its tools are planned to be released in the coming months under an open-source license.

## Availability
- The **model will be released on HuggingFace** once fine-tuning is completed: [Cogita I on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/beltromatti/cogita-I)
- The **project documentation and development repository are already available on GitHub**, including this README and the Noesis AI License:

## Noesis AI – Towards a New Cognitive Frontier
**Noesis AI** is a non-profit research organization based in Milan, Italy, committed to the ambitious pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Founded by Mattia Beltrami, a Computer Engineering student at Politecnico di Milano, Noesis AI is driven by the belief that current artificial intelligence paradigms—while powerful—remain fundamentally limited by architectures that are far removed from the principles of biological cognition.

Our mission is to bridge this gap.

We focus on developing new AI models and learning paradigms inspired by the structure and dynamics of the human brain. Our research spans multiple frontiers:

Neurosymbolic and neuro-inspired architectures: to move beyond Transformers toward more cognitively-aligned, efficient, and generalizable systems.

Novel training techniques: to enable emergent intelligence and abstraction capabilities with less supervision and greater data efficiency.

Efficient tensor computation: to design new paradigms and hardware-aware methods for dramatically accelerating inference and training, both on CPUs and specialized accelerators.

AI for medical innovation: applying our technologies to biomedical diagnostics, predictive modeling, and cognitive prosthetics.

Open science and collaboration: all our research is openly available through our GitHub repository github.com/noesisai, and we welcome contributors who share our vision.

We are currently in our foundational phase. While our products are still under development, our trajectory is clear: to push the limits of what machines can understand, learn, and become.

At Noesis AI, we recognize that we are living through an era of exponential change—an acceleration not just of technology, but of intelligence itself. To remain relevant, humanity must radically rethink its relationship with innovation. The frameworks that governed yesterday will not survive tomorrow. We believe that the future belongs to those who embrace adaptive, open, and interdisciplinary thinking.

Noesis, in ancient Greek, means "the act of understanding." Our vision is to build machines that don't just simulate intelligence—but truly understand.
